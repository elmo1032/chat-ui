# .env - A file that may contain environment variables for a project.
# .env.* - Any files with names starting with "env." (e.g. .env.development, .env.production)
# !.env.example - An exception to the previous rule, ensuring that the .env.example file is not ignored.

# The following lines are used to ignore lock files for various package managers:

# pnpm-lock.yaml - A lock file used by the PNPM package manager.
# pac,kage-lock.json - A lock file used by the NPM package manager.
